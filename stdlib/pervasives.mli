(** The initially opened module.

   This module provides the built-in types (numbers, booleans,
   strings, exceptions, references, lists, arrays, input-output channels, ...)
   and the basic operations over these types.

   This module is automatically opened at the beginning of each compilation.
   All components of this module can therefore be referred by their short
   name, without prefixing them by [Pervasives].
*)

(** {2 Predefined types} 
These are predefined types :
{ul
{- [type int ]

   The type of integer numbers.}
{- [type char ]

   The type of characters. }
{-  [type string]

   The type of character strings.}
{-  [type float]

   The type of floating-point numbers. }
{-  [type bool]

   The type of booleans (truth values).}
{-  [type unit = ()]

   The type of the unit value.}
{-  [type exn]

   The type of exception values.}
{-  [type 'a array] 

   The type of arrays whose elements have type ['a]. }
{-  [type 'a list = [] | :: of 'a * 'a list]

   The type of lists whose elements have type ['a].}
{-  [type 'a option = None | Some of 'a]

   The type of optional values. }
{-  [type ('a, 'b, 'c) format]

   The type of format strings. ['a] is the type of the parameters
   of the format, ['c] is the result type for the [printf]-style
   function, and ['b] is the type of the first argument given to
   [%a] and [%t] printing functions (see module {!Printf}). }}
*)

(** {2 Exceptions} *)

(** Raise the given exception value *)
external raise : exn -> 'a = "%raise"
        
(** These are predefined exceptions :
{ul
{- [exception Match_failure of (string * int * int)]

Exception raised when none of the cases of a pattern-matching
   apply. The arguments are the location of the pattern-matching
   in the source code (file name, position of first character,
   position of last character).
}
{- [exception Assert_failure of (string * int * int)]

Exception raised when an assertion fails.  The arguments are
   the location of the pattern-matching in the source code
   (file name, position of first character, position of last
   character).
}
{- [exception Invalid_argument of string]

Exception raised by library functions to signal that the given
   arguments do not make sense.
}
{- [exception Failure of string]

Exception raised by library functions to signal that they are
   undefined on the given arguments. 
}
{- [exception Not_found]

Exception raised by search functions when the desired object
   could not be found.
}
{- [exception Out_of_memory]

Exception raised by the garbage collector
   when there is insufficient memory to complete the computation.
}
{- [exception Stack_overflow]

Exception raised by the bytecode interpreter when the evaluation
   stack reaches its maximal size. This often indicates infinite
   or excessively deep recursion in the user's program.
}
{- [exception Sys_error of string]

Exception raised by the input/output functions to report
   an operating system error.
}
{- [exception End_of_file]

Exception raised by input functions to signal that the
   end of file has been reached.
}
{- [exception Division_by_zero]

Exception raised by division and remainder operations
   when their second argument is null.
}
{- [exception Sys_blocked_io]

A special case of [Sys_error] raised when no I/O is possible
   on a non-blocking I/O channel.
}}

    provided for use in your programs.*)

(** {2 Comparisons} *)


(** [e1 = e2] tests for structural equality of [e1] and [e2].
   Mutable structures (e.g. references and arrays) are equal
   if and only if their current contents are structurally equal,
   even if the two mutable objects are not the same physical object.
   Equality between functional values raises [Invalid_argument].
   Equality between cyclic data structures may not terminate. *)
external (=) : 'a -> 'a -> bool = "%equal"

(** Negation of [Pervasives.=]. *)
external (<>) : 'a -> 'a -> bool = "%notequal"


(** See {!Pervasives.>=}. *)
external (<) : 'a -> 'a -> bool = "%lessthan"
(** See {!Pervasives.>=}. *)
external (>) : 'a -> 'a -> bool = "%greaterthan"
(** See {!Pervasives.>=}. *)
external (<=) : 'a -> 'a -> bool = "%lessequal"

(** Structural ordering functions. These functions coincide with
   the usual orderings over integers, characters, strings
   and floating-point numbers, and extend them to a
   total ordering over all types.
   The ordering is compatible with [(=)]. As in the case
   of [(=)], mutable structures are compared by contents.
   Comparison between functional values raises [Invalid_argument].
   Comparison between cyclic structures may not terminate. *)
external (>=) : 'a -> 'a -> bool = "%greaterequal"

(** [compare x y] returns [0] if [x=y], a negative integer if
   [x<y], and a positive integer if [x>y]. The same restrictions
   as for [=] apply. [compare] can be used as the comparison function
   required by the {!Set} and {!Map} modules. *)
external compare: 'a -> 'a -> int = "compare"

(** Return the smaller of the two arguments. *)
val min: 'a -> 'a -> 'a

(** Return the greater of the two arguments. *)
val max: 'a -> 'a -> 'a

(** [e1 == e2] tests for physical equality of [e1] and [e2].
   On integers and characters, it is the same as structural
   equality. On mutable structures, [e1 == e2] is true if and only if
   physical modification of [e1] also affects [e2].
   On non-mutable structures, the behavior of [(==)] is
   implementation-dependent, except that [e1 == e2] implies
   [e1 = e2]. *)
external (==) : 'a -> 'a -> bool = "%eq"

(** Negation of {!Pervasives.==}. *)

(** {2 Boolean operations} *)


(** The boolean negation. *)
external not : bool -> bool = "%boolnot"

(** See {!Pervasives.&}. *)
external (&&) : bool -> bool -> bool = "%sequand"

   [e2] is not evaluated at all. *)
external (&) : bool -> bool -> bool = "%sequand"


(** See {!Pervasives.or}.*)
external (||) : bool -> bool -> bool = "%sequor"

(** The boolean ``or''. Evaluation is sequential, left-to-right:
   in [e1 || e2], [e1] is evaluated first, and if it returns [true],
   [e2] is not evaluated at all. *)
external (or) : bool -> bool -> bool = "%sequor"


(** {2 Integer arithmetic} *)

(** Integers are 31 bits wide (or 63 bits on 64-bit processors).
   All operations are taken modulo 2{^31} (or 2{^63}).
   They do not fail on overflow. *)

(** Unary negation. You can also write [-e] instead of [~-e]. *)
external (~-) : int -> int = "%negint"

(** [succ x] is [x+1]. *)

(** Integer subtraction. *)
external (-) : int -> int -> int = "%subint"

(** Integer multiplication. *)
external ( * ) : int -> int -> int = "%mulint"

(** Integer division.
   Raise [Division_by_zero] if the second argument is 0. *)
external (/) : int -> int -> int = "%divint"

(** Integer remainder.  If [x >= 0] and [y > 0], the result
   of [x mod y] satisfies the following properties:
   [0 <= x mod y < y] and
   [x = (x / y) * y + x mod y].
   If [y = 0], [x mod y] raises [Division_by_zero].
   If [x < 0] or [y < 0], the result of [x mod y] is
   not specified and depends on the platform. *)
external (mod) : int -> int -> int = "%modint"

(** Return the absolute value of the argument. *)
val abs : int -> int

(** The greatest representable integer. *)
val max_int: int
(** The smallest representable integer. *)

(** Bitwise logical negation. *)
val lnot: int -> int

(** [n lsl m] shifts [n] to the left by [m] bits.
   The result is unspecified if [m < 0] or [m >= bitsize],
   where [bitsize] is [32] on a 32-bit platform and
   [64] on a 64-bit platform. *)
external (lsl) : int -> int -> int = "%lslint"

(** [n lsr m] shifts [n] to the right by [m] bits.
   This is a logical shift: zeroes are inserted regardless of
   the sign of [n].
   The result is unspecified if [m < 0] or [m >= bitsize]. *)
external (lsr) : int -> int -> int = "%lsrint"

(** [n asr m] shifts [n] to the right by [m] bits.
   This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of [n] is replicated.
   The result is unspecified if [m < 0] or [m >= bitsize]. *)
external (asr) : int -> int -> int = "%asrint"
    

(** {2 Floating-point arithmetic}

   Caml's floating-point numbers follow the
   IEEE 754 standard, using double precision (64 bits) numbers.
   Floating-point operations never raise an exception on overflow,
   underflow, division by zero, etc.  Instead, special IEEE numbers
   are returned as appropriate, such as [infinity] for [1.0 /. 0.0],
   [neg_infinity] for [-1.0 /. 0.0], and [nan] (``not a number'')
   for [0.0 /. 0.0].  These special numbers then propagate through
   floating-point computations as expected: for instance,
   [1.0 /. infinity] is [0.0], and any operation with [nan] as 
   argument returns [nan] as result.

val open_in_bin : string -> in_channel

(** Open the named file for reading, as above. The extra arguments
   [mode] and [perm] specify the opening mode and file permissions.
   {!Pervasives.open_in} and {!Pervasives.open_in_bin} are special
   cases of this function. *)
val open_in_gen : open_flag list -> int -> string -> in_channel

(** Read one character from the given input channel.
   Raise [End_of_file] if there are no more characters to read. *)
val input_char : in_channel -> char

(** Read characters from the given input channel, until a
   newline character is encountered. Return the string of
   all characters read, without the newline character at the end.
   Raise [End_of_file] if the end of the file is reached
   at the beginning of line. *)
val input_line : in_channel -> string

(** Read up to [len] characters from the given channel,
   storing them in string [buf], starting at character number [pos].
   It returns the actual number of characters read, between 0 and
   [len] (inclusive).
   A return value of 0 means that the end of file was reached.
   A return value between 0 and [len] exclusive means that
   not all requested [len] characters were read, either because
   no more characters were available at that time, or because
   the implementation found it convenient to do a partial read;
   [input] must be called again to read the remaining characters,
   if desired.  (See also {!Pervasives.really_input} for reading
   exactly [len] characters.)
   Exception [Invalid_argument "input"] is raised if [pos] and [len]
   do not designate a valid substring of [buf]. *)          
val input : in_channel -> string -> int -> int -> int

(** Read [len] characters from the given channel, storing them in
   string [buf], starting at character number [pos].
   Raise [End_of_file] if the end of file is reached before [len]
   characters have been read.
   Raise [Invalid_argument "really_input"] if
   [pos] and [len] do not designate a valid substring of [buf]. *)
val really_input : in_channel -> string -> int -> int -> unit

(** Same as {!Pervasives.input_char}, but return the 8-bit integer representing
   the character.
   Raise [End_of_file] if an end of file was reached. *)
val input_byte : in_channel -> int

(** Read an integer encoded in binary format from the given input
   channel. See {!Pervasives.output_binary_int}.
   Raise [End_of_file] if an end of file was reached while reading the
   integer. *)
val input_binary_int : in_channel -> int

(** Read the representation of a structured value, as produced
   by {!Pervasives.output_value}, and return the corresponding value.
   This function is identical to {!Marshal.from_channel};
   see the description of module {!Marshal} for more information,
   in particular concerning the lack of type safety. *)
val input_value : in_channel -> 'a

(** [seek_in chan pos] sets the current reading position to [pos]
   for channel [chan]. This works only for regular files. On
   files of other kinds, the behavior is unspecified. *)
val seek_in : in_channel -> int -> unit

(** Return the current reading position for the given channel. *)
val pos_in : in_channel -> int

(** Return the total length (number of characters) of the
   given channel. This works only for regular files. On files of
   other kinds, the result is meaningless. *)
val in_channel_length : in_channel -> int

(** Close the given channel.  A [Sys_error] exception is raised
   if any of the functions above is called on a closed channel. *)
val close_in : in_channel -> unit

(** [set_binary_mode_in ic true] sets the channel [ic] to binary
   mode: no translations take place during input.
   [set_binary_mode_out ic false] sets the channel [ic] to text
   mode: depending on the operating system, some translations
   may take place during input.  For instance, under Windows,
   end-of-lines will be translated from [\r\n] to [\n].
   This function has no effect under operating systems that
   do not distinguish between text mode and binary mode. *)
val set_binary_mode_in : in_channel -> bool -> unit


(** {2 References} *)


(** The type of references (mutable indirection cells) containing
   a value of type ['a]. *)
type 'a ref = { mutable contents: 'a }

(** Return a fresh reference containing the given value. *)
external ref : 'a -> 'a ref = "%makemutable"

(** [!r] returns the current contents of reference [r].
   Equivalent to [fun r -> r.contents]. *)
external (!) : 'a ref -> 'a = "%field0"

(** [r := a] stores the value of [a] in reference [r].
   Equivalent to [fun r v -> r.contents <- v]. *)
external (:=) : 'a ref -> 'a -> unit = "%setfield0"

(** Increment the integer contained in the given reference.
   Equivalent to [fun r -> r := succ !r]. *)
external incr : int ref -> unit = "%incr"

(** Decrement the integer contained in the given reference.
   Equivalent to [fun r -> r := pred !r]. *)
external decr : int ref -> unit = "%decr"


(** {2 Program termination} *)


(** Flush all pending writes on {!Pervasives.stdout} and
   {!Pervasives.stderr},
   and terminate the process, returning the given status code
   to the operating system (usually 0 to indicate no errors,
   and a small positive integer to indicate failure.) 
   An implicit [exit 0] is performed each time a program
   terminates normally (but not if it terminates because of
   an uncaught exception). *)
val exit : int -> 'a

(** Register the given function to be called at program
   termination time. The functions registered with [at_exit]
   will be called when the program executes {!Pervasives.exit}. 
   They will not be called if the program
   terminates because of an uncaught exception.
   The functions are called in ``last in, first out'' order:
   the function most recently added with [at_exit] is called first. *)
val at_exit: (unit -> unit) -> unit
