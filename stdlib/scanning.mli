(** The run-time library for scanners. *)

(** {7 Scanning buffers} *)

type scanbuf;;
(** The type of scanning buffers. A scanning buffer is the argument passed
   to the scanning functions used by the [scanf] family functions.
   The scanning buffer holds the current state of the scan, plus
   a function to find the next char from the input, and a token buffer
   to store the string matched so far. *)

val next_char : scanbuf -> unit;;
(** [Scanning.next_char scanbuf] advance the scanning buffer for
    one character. *)

val peek_char : scanbuf -> char;;
(** [Scanning.peek_char scanbuf] returns the current char available in
    the input. *)

val end_of_input : scanbuf -> bool;;
(** [Scanning.end_of_input scanbuf] tests the end of input condition
    of the given buffer. *)

val char_count : scanbuf -> int;;
(** [Scanning.char_count scanbuf] returns the number of characters read
    from the given buffer. *)

val token : scanbuf -> string;;
(** [Scanning.token scanbuf] returns the string stored into the token
    buffer of the scanning buffer: it returns the token matched by the
    format. *)

val store_char : scanbuf -> char -> int -> int;;
(** [Scanning.store_char scanbuf c lim] adds [c] to the token buffer
    of the scanning buffer. It returns [lim - 1], indicating that there
    is one less character to read. *)

val reset_token : scanbuf -> unit;;
(** [Scanning.reset_token scanbuf] rests to zero the token buffer of
    the given scanning buffer. *)

val from_string : string -> scanbuf;;
(** Create a scanning buffer which reads from the given string.
    Reading starts from the first character in the string.
    The end-of-input condition is set when the end of the string is reached. *)

val from_channel : in_channel -> scanbuf;;
(** Create a scanning buffer on the given input channel.
    [Scanning.from_channel inchan] returns a scanning buffer which reads
    from the input channel [inchan], at the current reading position. *)

val from_function : (unit -> char) -> scanbuf;;
(** Create a scanning buffer with the given function as its reading method.
    When the scanning needs one more character, it calls the given function. *)
