(* Module [Set]: sets over ordered types *)

(* This module implements the set data structure, given a total ordering
   function over the set elements. All operations over sets
   are purely applicative (no side-effects).
   The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and is therefore
   reasonably efficient: insertion and membership take time
   logarithmic in the size of the set, for instance. *)

module type OrderedType =
  sig
    type t
    val compare: t -> t -> int
  end
          (* The input signature of the functor [Set.Make].
             [t] is the type of the set elements.
             [compare] is a total ordering function over the set elements.
             This is a two-argument function [f] such that
             [f e1 e2] is zero if the elements [e1] and [e2] are equal,
             [f e1 e2] is strictly negative if [e1] is smaller than [e2],
             and [f e1 e2] is strictly positive if [e1] is greater than [e2].
             Examples: a suitable ordering function for type [int]
             is [prefix -]. You can also use the generic structural comparison
             function [compare]. *)
