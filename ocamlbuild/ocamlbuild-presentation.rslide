slide "Why such a tool?" do
  * To make our OCaml life easier.
  * A Makefile is so painful.
end

slide "What does ocamlbuild handle?" do

  box "Regular OCaml projects of arbitrary size" do
    > Trivially handled using the command line options.
  end

  box "Mostly regular OCaml projects with common exceptions" do
    > Requires writing one _tag_ file that declares those exceptions.
  end

  box "Almost any project" do
    > Accomplished by writing an ocamlbuild plugin.
  end

end

slide "What kind of services for a project?" do
  * Compilation of the whole project.
  * Minimal re-compilation after a change.
  * Other builds like the documentation.
  * Different build directories at a same time.
  * Cleaning of what's built.
  * Keeping an hygienic source directory.
  * Saving time!
end

slide "What's a regular OCaml project?" do
  * OCaml compilation units (ml and mli files).
  * OCaml parsers and lexers specifications (mly and mll files).
  * Internal packages and libraries (mlpack, mllib).
  * Use of external libraries.
  * One main OCaml unit that represents the starting point.
end

slide "How difficult are regular projects?" do
  * 
end

slide "What's an exception?" do
  box "Some flags can be different for some files" do
    * Enable/disable some warning flags.
    * Debugging (-g), profiling (-p), type annotations flags,
      recursive types, -linkall, -thread, -custom.
  end
  * Have to link this binary with that library.
  * Include or exclude that directory.
  * Some dependencies.
end

slide "??Make?? and exceptions" do
  * The ??make?? tool can handle rules but not exceptions.
  * With ??make?? exceptions are encoded as specific rules.
  * This generally makes rules and exceptions tightly bound by variables.
  * This way totally doesn't scale, and is not *modular*.
end

slide "The tags, our way to specify exceptions" do
  box "Rules produce commands with *tagged holes*" do
    : let tagged_hole = tags_for(ml)++"ocaml"++"compile"++"byte" in
      Cmd(S[A"ocamlc"; A"-c"; T(tagged_hole); P ml; A"-o"; Px cmo])
  end
  box "These holes can be filled by some command pieces (flags)" do
    : flag ["ocaml"; "compile"; "byte"; "rectypes"] (A"-rectypes")
  end
  box "Files can also be tagged and make things happen" do
    : "foo/bar.ml": rectypes
  end
end

slide "The tags file (_tags)" do
  * Each line is a pattern and a set of tags.
  * The pattern is a boolean tree (*and*, *or*, *not*).
  * Leafs are either constant strings or glob patterns.
  * In the set of tags, they can appear positively or negatively.
