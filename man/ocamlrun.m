.TH CSLRUN 1

.SH NAME
ocamlrun \- The Objective Caml bytecode interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ocamlrun
[
.B \-v
]
.I filename argument ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.BR ocamlrun (1)
command executes bytecode files produced by the
linking phase of the 
.BR ocamlc (1)
command.

The first non-option argument is taken to be the name of the file
containing the executable bytecode. (That file is searched in the
executable path as well as in the current directory.) The remaining
arguments are passed to the Caml Light program, in the string array
Sys.argv. Element 0 of this array is the name of the
bytecode executable file; elements 1 to 
.I n
are the remaining arguments.

In most cases, the bytecode
executable files produced by the 
.BR ocamlc (1)
command are self-executable,
and manage to launch the 
.BR ocamlrun (1)
command on themselves automatically.

.SH OPTIONS

The following command-line option is recognized by 
.BR ocamlrun (1).

.TP
.B \-v 
When set, the memory manager prints verbose messages on standard error

.TP
.B CAMLRUNPARAM

.TP
.BR s \ (minor_heap_size)
Size of the minor heap.
.TP
.BR i \ (major_heap_increment)
Minimum size increment for the major heap.
.TP
.BR o \ (space_overhead)
The major GC speed setting.
.TP
