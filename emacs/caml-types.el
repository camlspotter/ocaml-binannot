; WARNING:
; This code is experimental.  Everything may change at any time.

; An emacs-lisp complement to the "-dtypes" option of ocamlc and ocamlopt.
; Load this file in your emacs, then C-c C-t will show you the
; type of the expression (or pattern) that contains the cursor.
; The expression is highlighted in the current buffer.
; The type is highlighted in "foo.annot" (if your file is "foo.ml"),
; which is convenient when the type doesn't fit on a line.


; Hints on using the type display:

; . If you want the type of an identifier, put the cursor in any
;   occurrence of this identifier (as expression or as pattern) and
;   type C-c C-t
; . If you want the result type of a function application, put the
;   cursor at the first space after the function name
; . If you want the type of a list, put the cursor on a bracket,
;   or on a semicolon, or on the :: constructor
; . Even if type checking fails, you can still look at the types
;   in the file, up to where the type checker failed.
; . To get rid of the highlighting, put the cursor in a comment
;   and type C-c C-t.
; . The mark in the foo.annot file is set to the beginning of the
;   type, so you can type C-x C-x in that file to view the type.



; TO DO:
; - make emacs scroll the foo.annot file to show the type
; - (?) integrate this file into caml.el


; Format of the *.annot files:

; file ::= block *
; block ::= position <SP> position <LF> annotation *
; position ::= filename <SP> num <SP> num <SP> num
; annotation ::= keyword open-paren <LF> <SP> <SP> data <LF> close-paren

; <SP> is a space character (ASCII 0x20)
; <LF> is a line-feed character (ASCII 0x0A)
; num is a sequence of decimal digits
; filename is a string with the lexical conventions of O'Caml
; open-paren is an open parenthesis (ASCII 0x28)
; close-paren is a closed parenthesis (ASCII 0x29)
; data is any sequence of characters where <LF> is always followed by
;      at least two space characters.

; in each block, the two positions are respectively the start and the
; end of the range described by the block.
; in a position, the filename is the name of the file, the first num
; is the line number, the second num is the offset of the beginning
; of the line, the third num is the offset of the position itself.
; the char number within the line is the difference between the third
; and second nums.

; For the moment, the only possible keyword is "type".
