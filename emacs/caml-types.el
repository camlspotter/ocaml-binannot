; WARNING:
; This code is experimental.  Everything may change at any time.

; An emacs-lisp complement to the "-dtypes" option of ocamlc and ocamlopt.
; Load this file in your emacs, then C-c C-t will show you the
; type of the expression (or pattern) that contains the cursor.
; The expression is highlighted in the current buffer.
; The type is highlighted in "foo.types" (if your file is "foo.ml"),
; which is convenient when the type doesn't fit on a line.


; Hints on using the type display:

; . If you want the type of an identifier, put the cursor in any
;   occurrence of this identifier (as expression or as pattern) and
;   type C-c C-t
; . If you want the result type of a function application, put the
;   cursor at the first space after the function name
; . If you want the type of a list, put the cursor on a bracket,
;   or on a semicolon, or on the :: constructor
; . Even if type checking fails, you can still look at the types
;   in the file, up to and including where the type checker failed.
; . The system doesn't "see" parentheses and begin/end.  If you
;   put the cursor on a parenthesis, you will have the type of
;   the expression that contains the parenthesized expression.
;   If you want the parenthesized expression, you need to put the
;   cursor inside it (for example, in a space between its words).
; . To get rid of the highlighting, put the cursor in a comment
;   and type C-c C-t.
; . The mark in the .types file is set to the beginning of the
;   type, so you can type C-x C-x to view the type in that file.



; TO DO:
; - make emacs scroll the .types file to show the type
; - (?) integrate this file into caml.el
