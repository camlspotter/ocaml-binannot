Some examples for LablTk.
Only demo.ml and tetris.ml really need to be compiled with the -labels option.
You may either compile them here, or just run them as scripts with
        labltk -labels example.ml

hello.ml        A very simple example of CamlTk
hello.tcl       The same programme in Tcl/Tk

demo.ml         A demonstration using many widget classes  (use -labels)

eyes.ml         A "bind" test

calc.ml         A little calculator

clock.ml        An analog clock  (use unix.cma)

tetris.ml       You NEED a game also (use -labels)
