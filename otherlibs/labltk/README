LablTk41 is a library for interfacing Objective Labl with the scripting
language Tcl/Tk (all versions since 7.5/4.1, but no betas).

In addition to the basic interface with Tcl/Tk, this package contains
 * the LablBrowser code editor / library browser written by Jacques
 Garrigue.
 * the "jpf" library, written by Jun P. Furuse; it contains a "file
 selector" and "balloon help" support
