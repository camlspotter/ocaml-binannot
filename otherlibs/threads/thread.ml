(* It is mucho important that the primitives that reschedule are called 
   through an ML function call, not directly. That's because when such a
   primitive returns, the bytecode interpreter is only semi-obedient:
   it takes sp from the new thread, but keeps pc from the old thread.
   But that's OK if all calls to rescheduling primitives are immediately
   followed by a RETURN operation, which will restore the correct pc
   from the stack. *)
