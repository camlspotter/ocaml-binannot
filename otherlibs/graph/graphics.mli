(*** Initializations *)

val open_graph: string -> unit
        (* Show the graphics window or switch the screen to graphic mode.
           The graphics window is cleared and the current point is set
           to (0, 0). The string argument is used to pass optional
           information on the desired graphics mode, the graphics window
           size, and so on. Its interpretation is implementation-dependent.
           If the empty string is given, a sensible default is selected. *)

           Under X Windows, [set_line_width 0] selects a width of 1 pixel
           and a faster, but less precise drawing algorithm than the one

           not be modified, while other points will be set to the color
           of the corresponding point in the image. This allows superimposing
           an image over an existing background. *)

external make_image : color array array -> image = "gr_make_image"
        (* Convert the given color matrix to an image.
           Each sub-array represents one horizontal line. All sub-arrays

           is transparent. *)

        (* [blit_image img x y] copies screen pixels into the image [img],
           modifying [img] in-place. The pixels copied are those inside the
           rectangle with lower left corner at [x,y], and width and height
           equal to those of the image. Pixels that were transparent in
           [img] are left unchanged. *)

(*** Mouse and keyboard events *)

external wait_next_event : event list -> status = "gr_wait_event"
        (* Wait until one of the events specified in the given event list
           occurs, and return the status of the mouse and keyboard at
           that time. If [Poll] is given in the event list, return immediately
           with the current status. If the mouse cursor is outside of the
           graphics window, the [mouse_x] and [mouse_y] fields of the event are
           outside the range [0..size_x()-1, 0..size_y()-1]. Keypresses
           are queued, and dequeued one by one when the [Key_pressed]

(*** Mouse and keyboard polling *)

val mouse_pos : unit -> int * int
        (* Return the position of the mouse cursor, relative to the

val button_down : unit -> bool
        (* Return [true] if the mouse button is pressed, [false] otherwise. *)
val read_key : unit -> char
        (* Wait for a key to be pressed, and return the corresponding
           character. Keypresses are queued. *)
val key_pressed : unit -> bool
        (* Return [true] if a keypress is available; that is, if [read_key]
           would not block. *)

(*** Sound *)

external sound : int -> int -> unit = "gr_sound"
        (* [sound freq dur] plays a sound at frequency [freq] (in hertz)
           for a duration [dur] (in milliseconds). *)
