# You can define CPPFLAGS on the command line.  Aside from system-specific
# flags, you can define:
#   -d DEBUG to enable the compiled pattern disassembler and execution
#           tracing; code runs substantially slower.
#   -d EXTRACT_MACROS to use the macros EXTRACT_* (as opposed to
#           the corresponding C procedures).  If not -d DEBUG, the macros
#           are used.
