           code. [WSIGNALED] means that the process was killed by a signal;
           the argument is the signal number. [WSTOPPED] means
           that the process was stopped by a signal; the argument is the
           signal number. *)

type wait_flag =

           A pid of [-1] means wait for any child.
           A pid of [0] means wait for any child in the same process group
           as the current process.
           Negative pid arguments represent process groups.
           The list of options indicates whether [waitpid] should return
           immediately without waiting, or also report stopped children. *)
val system : string -> process_status
        (* Execute the given command, wait until it terminates, and return
           its termination status. The string is interpreted by the shell
           [/bin/sh] and therefore can contain redirections, quotes, variables,

           is created in binary mode (no translation).
           In contrast, [in_channel_of_descr] and [out_channel_of_descr_bin]
           return channels that are set to text mode (translation of
           end-of-lines may take place).  This makes no difference under
           Unix, where text mode and binary mode are identical,
           but this matters under Windows. *)

           opened. *)
val set_nonblock : file_descr -> unit
val clear_nonblock : file_descr -> unit
        (* Set or clear the ``non-blocking'' flag on the given descriptor.
           When the non-blocking flag is set, reading on a descriptor
           on which there is temporarily no data available raises the
           [EAGAIN] or [EWOULDBLOCK] error instead of blocking;
           writing on a descriptor on which there is temporarily no room

           process is returned immediately; the new process executes
           concurrently with the current process.
           The standard input and outputs of the new process are connected
           to the descriptors [new_stdin], [new_stdout] and [new_stderr].
           Passing e.g. [stdout] for [new_stdout] prevents the redirection
           and causes the new process to have the same standard output
           as the current process.
           The executable file [prog] is searched in the path.
           The new process has the same environment as the current process.
           All file descriptors of the current process are closed in the
