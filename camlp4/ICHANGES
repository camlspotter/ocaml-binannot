Camlp4s Version 3.06+19
-----------------------

- [28 Oct 02] Changed and simplified local entry of pa_o.ml from "cvalue"
  to "cvalue_binding".
- [18 Oct 02] The standard syntax for antiquotations in object class_types
  and object class_expr are now: <:class_type< $opt:x$ $list:y$ >> and
  <:class_expr< $opt:x$ $list:y$ >>: the syntax without the "opt" is
  accepted but deprecated (a warning is displayed).
- [15 Oct 02] Changed Plexer which now manages better the line directives
  (applied only on begin of lines, no error if parsing error in the
  directive).
- [14 Sep 02] Grammar.print_entry does not end any more with
  Format.print_flush. The "flush" is done by Grammar.Entry.print.
