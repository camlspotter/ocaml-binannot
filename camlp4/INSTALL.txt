IMPORTANT REMARK

The present sources distribution already compiles and installs Camlp4:
everything in the OCaml directory above.

Except for the native win32 compilation using Visual C++!!!

If you are compiling OCaml for this distribution, you need to compile
Camlp4 afterwards, following the instructions below. Otherwise nothing
has to be done.

INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS FOR NATIVE WIN32

1- For the compilation, you need the OCaml compiler, "ocamlc" installed
   in your machine. Use the Cygwin environment, a development tool for
   Windows made by Cygnus. Find information and download in the Web.

2- From this directory, type:
        ./configure
   and follow the instructions

3- Do:
        make world
   This builds "camlp4" and some useful files.

4- (Optional) To be sure everything works well, you can try to bootstrap the
   system. Do:
        make bootstrap

5- (Optional) If your platform is supported by the native-code compiler, you
   can build the native-code camlp4 library. To know if it is the case, just
   type:
        ocamlopt -v
   If the answer is "The Objective Caml native-code, etc...", it exists.
   If the answer is something like "command not found", no.
   So, if you have it, you can do:
        make opt

6- You can now install the camlp4 system. This will create the command
   "camlp4" and some other commands and install library files. Do:
        make install

7- Test the system by pretty printing your OCaml source files:
        camlp4o pr_o.cmo foo.ml
   "foo.ml" being one of your OCaml source files.
