INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN UNIX MACHINES

1- For the compilation, you need the Objective Caml compiler, "ocamlc"
   installed in your machine, and its library "dynlink" installed too
   (which is the default).

2- From the top directory, do:
        ./configure
   and follow the instructions

3- Do:
        make world
   This builds "camlp4" and some useful files.

4- (Optional) To be sure everything works well, you can try to bootstrap the
   system. Do:
        make bootstrap

5- (Optional) If your platform is supported by the native-code compiler, you
   can build the native-code camlp4 library. To know if it is the case, just
   type:
        ocamlopt -v
   If the answer is "The Objective Caml native-code, etc...", it exists.
   If the answer is something like "command not found", no.
   So, if you have it, you can do:
        make opt

6- You can now install the camlp4 system. This will create the command
   "camlp4" and install library files. Become root and do:
        make install

7- Test the system by pretty printing your Objective Caml source files:
        camlp4o pr_o.cmo foo.ml
   "foo.ml" being one of your Objective Caml source files.


INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN WINDOWS

The better way to compile camlp4 is to use Gnu-Win32, a development
tool for Windows NT/95 made by Cygnus. You can find informations and
download it at location:

      http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/

Then edit the file "config/Makefile.tpl" and change the line
      EXE=
into:
      EXE=.exe

Then follow the same instructions than for unix above.

Possible problems:

- When you type "./configure" (point 2 above), the second question may
be skipped without asking. This is a (known) bug of Cygnus Beta 19. To
go around this problem, edit the file "configure" and change the line
"read r" into "read r; read s" and try again.
