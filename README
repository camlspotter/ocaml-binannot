OVERVIEW:

Objective Caml is an implementation of the ML language, based on
the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.

Objective Caml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.

The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
the generated programs deliver excellent performance (better than
Standard ML of New Jersey 1.08 on our tests), while retaining the
moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. The native-code
compiler currently runs on the following platforms:

    Alpha processors: DecStation 3000 under OSF1 (a.k.a. Digital Unix)
    Sparc processors: Sun Sparcstation under SunOS 4.1, Solaris 2, NetBSD
    Intel 486 and Pentium processors: PCs under Linux, NextStep,
                                      FreeBSD, Solaris 2
    Mips processors: DecStation 3100 and 5000 under Ultrix 4
    HP PA-RISC processors: HP 9000/700 under HPUX 9 and NextStep
    PowerPC processors: IBM RS6000 and PowerPC workstations under AIX 3.2,
                        PowerMacintosh under MkLinux
    Motorola 680x0 processors: Sun 3 under SunOS

Other operating systems for the processors above have not been tested,
but the compiler may work under other operating systems with little work.

Before the introduction of objects, Objective Caml was known as Caml
Special Light. Objective Caml is almost upwards compatible with Caml
Special Light, except for a few additional reserved keywords that have
forced some renamings of standard library functions. The script
tools/csl2ocaml in the distribution can be used to automate the
conversion from Caml Special Light to Objective Caml.

INSTALLATION:

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions on Unix machines. 

DOCUMENTATION:

The Objective Caml manual is distributed in Postscript, DVI, and
plain text. It can be obtained by anonymous FTP from ftp.inria.fr as
described below. It is also available on the World Wide Web, at

        http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/

AVAILABILITY:

The complete Objective Caml distribution resides on ftp.inria.fr,
and can be accessed by anonymous FTP:

        host:       ftp.inria.fr (192.93.2.54)
        directory:  lang/caml-light

or through a Web browser at ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light/.

KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH THE CAML COMMUNITY:

There exists a mailing list of users of the Caml implementations
developed at INRIA. The purpose of this list is to share
experience, exchange ideas (and even code), and report on applications
of the Caml language. This list is moderated; messages can be
written in English or in French. The list has about 200 subscribers.

Messages to the list should be sent to:

              caml-list@inria.fr

If you wish to subscribe to this list, please send a message
(including your email address) to:

              caml-list-request@inria.fr

Archives of the list are available on the World Wide Web at URL
http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/.

The Usenet news groups comp.lang.ml and comp.lang.functional
also contains discussions about the ML family of programming languages,
including Caml.

BUG REPORTS AND USER FEEDBACK:

Send your bug reports by E-mail to:

          caml-light@inria.fr

To be effective, bug reports should include a complete program
(preferably small) that exhibits the unexpected behavior, and the
configuration you are using (machine type, etc).

The mailing list caml-light@inria.fr is forwarded to
a small group of implementors at INRIA. For general questions and
discussions, caml-list@inria.fr is better; for bug reports
and very specific technical questions, caml-light@inria.fr
is preferred. We often cross-post from one list to the other, anyway.
