OVERVIEW:

Objective Caml is an implementation of the ML language, based on
the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.

Objective Caml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.

The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining
the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. The
native-code compiler currently runs on the following platforms:

    Intel Pentium processors: PCs under Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
      Windows, NextStep, Solaris 2, BeOS.
    Alpha processors: Digital/Compaq Alpha machines under
      Digital Unix/Compaq Tru64, Linux, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
    Sparc processors: Sun Sparc under Solaris 2, NetBSD, Linux
    Mips processors: SGI workstations and mainframes under IRIX 6
    HP PA-RISC processors: HP 9000/700 under HPUX 10
    PowerPC processors: PowerMacintosh under MacOS X, LinuxPPC,
                        IBM RS6000 and PowerPC workstations under AIX 4.3
    Strong ARM processors: Corel Netwinder under Linux
    Intel IA64 processors: HP stations under Linux

Other operating systems for the processors above have not been tested,
but the compiler may work under other operating systems with little work.

Before the introduction of objects, Objective Caml was known as Caml
Special Light. Objective Caml is almost upwards compatible with Caml
Special Light, except for a few additional reserved keywords that have
forced some renaming of standard library functions.

KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH THE CAML COMMUNITY:

There exists a mailing list of users of the Caml implementations
developed at INRIA. The purpose of this list is to share
experience, exchange ideas (and even code), and report on applications
of the Caml language. Messages can be written in English or in
French. The list has about 500 subscribers.

Messages to the list should be sent to:

              caml-list@inria.fr

If you wish to subscribe to this list, please send a message to:

              caml-list-request@inria.fr

with the single word "subscribe" in the body of the message.

Archives of the list are available on the World Wide Web at URL
http://caml.inria.fr/

The Usenet news groups comp.lang.ml and comp.lang.functional
also contains discussions about the ML family of programming languages,
including Caml.

BUG REPORTS AND USER FEEDBACK:

Send your bug reports by E-mail to:

              caml-bugs@inria.fr

or report them using the Web interface to the bug-tracking system
at http://caml.inria.fr/bin/caml-bugs

To be effective, bug reports should include a complete program
(preferably small) that exhibits the unexpected behavior, and the
configuration you are using (machine type, etc).

You can also contact the implementors directly at caml@inria.fr.
