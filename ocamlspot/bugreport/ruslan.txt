1. There is a bug in the emacs configuration, one of the lines should read
something like:

 ;; load path
 (setq load-path (cons "/usr/local/lib/ocaml/ocamlspot/" load-path))

2. The folder ocamlspotter-1.05/ocamlspot is required when compiling and
should be copied to the ocaml-3.11.1 root folder. Is this what you mean when you say

  - check the directory ocamlspot exists

in the INSTALL-... file?

3. After compiling, the folder ocaml-3.11.1/ocamlspot should be automatically copied to
whatever place ocaml was installed.

I hope this comments are useful for your next release.
