0. If you have no time to read the following, just try the script in the package:
  
    $ ./BRAIN_DEAD_INSTALL.sh

  It will clone the official source of version 3.12.0 in the current directory, then apply the patch, and compile with the default configuration. Jump to 8 for the emacs lisp installation.

1. Ok, you are not brain dead. Download OCaml compiler version 3.12.0:

  - grab it from http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/3.12.0.tar.gz
  - You can also use the SVN version
    ( svn checkout http://caml.inria.fr/svn/ocaml/release/3.12.0 )

2. Extract the compiler source.

  - tar zxvf ocaml-3.12.0.tar.gz
  - cd ocaml-3.12.0                 # do not forget this

3. Extract ocamlspot.tgz and Apply the patch

  - tar zxvf ocamlspotter-3.12.0-1.2.1.tgz
  - mv ocamlspotter-3.12.0-1.2.1/* .
  - patch -p1 < compiler_patch.diff

  Check your patched source tree. It should have ocamlspot directory with the original files like INSTALL, LICENSE and VERSION.

4. Build a bytecode compiler

  - ./configure
  - make core coreboot

5. Manual ocamlbuild bootstrap:

   Do not forget the following after make coreboot:

  - ./build/mixed-boot.sh
  - cp boot/myocamlbuild boot/myocamlbuild.boot

6. Continue building

  - make world
  - make opt
  - make opt.opt

7. Check the patched compiler is compatible with the original

  You can use VERIFY.sh to check that the patched compiler produces the same object files as the orignal compiler.

8. Install it

  - make install

9. Emacs interface

  Write the following into your .emacs:

  ; load-path
  (setq load-path (cons "WHERE-YOU-HAVE-INSTALLED-THE-ELISP" load-path))
 
  ; set the path of the ocamlspot binary
  (setq ocamlspot-path "WHERE-YOU-HAVE-INSTALLED-THE-BINARIES/ocamlspot")
 
  ; autoload
  (autoload 'ocamlspot-query "ocamlspot" "OCamlSpot")
 
  ; tuareg mode hook (use caml-mode-hook instead if you use caml-mode)
    (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 
    	  '(lambda ()
  	     (local-set-key "\C-c;" 'ocamlspot-query)
  	     (local-set-key "\C-c\C-t" 'ocamlspot-type)
             (local-set-key "\C-c\C-y" 'ocamlspot-type-and-copy)
  	     (local-set-key "\C-c\C-u" 'ocamlspot-use)
  	     (local-set-key "\C-ct" 'caml-types-show-type)))
 
10. How to use

  Compiler your ML project by this patched compiler with -annot option to create .spot files. Open one of the source files in Emacs and place the cursor at the name whose definition is in question. Type C-c; will show you the defintion.
